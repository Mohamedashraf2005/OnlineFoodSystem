Object-Oriented Design:
The Online Food Ordering System is built using object-oriented programming principles, with classes representing entities such as Customer, Restaurant, Order, Payment, and Feedback. Each class encapsulates relevant data and functionality, promoting code reuse and modularity.

Inheritance and polymorphism are utilized to model relationships between classes and to enable the extension of functionality without modifying existing code. For example, different payment methods can be implemented as subclasses of the Payment class.
utilizes file storage to persistently store data, facilitating the dynamic creation and destruction of objects during runtime.
