Online Ordering System Documentation

This document outlines the functionalities and user experience of the online ordering system, including file management.

System Startup

Upon running the program, the user encounters a welcome message followed by a prompt to identify as either an "owner" or a "customer."

User Roles

The system caters to two user roles:

    Owner:
        Grants access to the Owner class, which provides functionalities for:
            Menu Management:
                Adding new menu items to the system. This might involve updating the resturant.txt file.
            Customer Management (Optional):
                Potential functionalities like viewing or modifying customer information can be implemented, but data privacy considerations should be addressed.

    Customer:
        Provides access to the Customer class, offering features like:
            Authentication:
                Signing in (existing customer) using credentials stored in the customerorder.txt file.
                Signing up (new customer) to create a new account, which involves adding a new entry to the customerorder.txt file.
            Browsing Menu:
                The system retrieves and displays product information from the resturant.txt file.
            Item Selection:
                Customers choose items by their corresponding numbers listed in the resturant.txt file.
            Quantity Selection:
                Customers specify the desired quantity for each chosen item.
            Ending Selection:
                Entering "-1" signifies the completion of item selection.

Order Processing

    The Order class takes over after item selection.
    It presents a well-formatted table summarizing the chosen items:
        Item names
        Corresponding quantities
        Individual item prices
        Total order price before delivery charges

Payment Processing

    Control transfers to the Payment class upon confirming the order.
    The system displays the total bill amount along with available payment options (e.g., Visa, cash).
        Visa Payment: (if implemented)
            Requires entering a 15-digit Visa ID and a 4-digit password for verification.

Delivery Processing

    The Delivery class takes care of delivery selection.
    Customers choose their delivery area, which might incur additional charges based on location.

Feedback

    After payment confirmation, the Feedback class (optional) allows 
    customers to rate the system's performance and food quality on a 5-star scale.

Order Completion

    The system presents a prompt asking the customer to confirm the order by entering "yes" or "no."
        "Yes":
            The order is finalized with a unique order ID assigned.
            A receipt is generated and displayed, containing:
                Customer name
                Order ID
                Order status (confirmed)
                Total price (including delivery charges, if applicable)
                Date and time of order placement
            The customer's order details are appended to the customerorder.txt file.
            A separate file named lastcustomer.txt is updated to reflect the most recent customer's information.
        "No":
            The program gracefully exits, and the order is not placed.

File Management

The system relies on three text files for data storage:

    customerorder.txt:
        Stores all customer order history, including:
            Customer name
            Password (secure hashing is recommended for password storage)
            Ordered items (names and quantities)
    lastcustomer.txt:
        Contains information about the most recent customer who signed in and placed an order, including:
            Customer name
            Most recent order details (similar to customerorder.txt)
   resturant.txt:
        Stores menu items, including:
            Item names with id
            Prices
