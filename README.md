This document outlines an online ordering system designed to simplify the take-out process for both customers and restaurant owners.

User Roles:

    Customers: Browse menus, place orders, select delivery options, and provide feedback.
    Owners: Manage menus (add/remove items), and remove customers.

Core Functionalities:

    User Authentication: Customers can sign up for new accounts or log in to existing ones.
    Menu Management: Owners can edit the menu by adding or removing items directly from a menu file.
    Order Building: Customers browse the menu, select items, specify quantities, and finalize their orders.
    Order Summary & Payment: A clear breakdown of the order is presented with total cost. Customers can then choose their preferred payment method.
    Delivery Selection: Customers choose their delivery area and any associated delivery fees are calculated.
    Feedback: Customers can rate their experience with both the online system and the food quality.
